This repo contains a collection of anonymous feedbacks from MEIC students about the courses they've taken.
Feel free to explore the [courses](./courses) directory to see the feedbacks that we've been collecting over the years.
That directory has one file per course, with the feedbacks from the students who took that course.

We've also added two indices, to help you find the courses you're looking for:
- [by specialization](./indices/by_specialization.md)
- [by period](./indices/by_period.md)
